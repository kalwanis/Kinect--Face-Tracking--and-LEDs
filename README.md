Kincet--Face-Tracking--and-LEDs
===============================

Project for Creative Programming II at RISD, using the Kinect for Xbox 360 and Arduino. The code was written in C# by modifying the Kinect's FaceTracking WPF (all the additions were made in FaceTrackingViewer.xaml.cs). It has the Kinect calculate the yaw (y-axis head rotation) to control some LEDs. 


See the demo on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baI8-AaCJMU&noredirect=1


You will need:

Microsoft Kinect SDK

Microsoft Kinect Face Tracking SDK

Microsoft Visual Studio Express


Kinect Xbox 360

Arduino (the schematic is provided)

Jumper wires

7 mini breadboards

6 100ohm ¼ watt resistors

6 5mm LEDs (any color)



Wire everything, upload the Arduino sketch, and press start/debug in the Visual Studio file.
